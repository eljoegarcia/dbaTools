Function Remove-DbaBackup
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Remove SQL Server backups from disk

.DESCRIPTION
Provides all of the same functionality for removing SQL backups from disk as a standard maintenance plan would.

As an addition you have the ability to check the Archive bit on files before deletion. This will allow you to ensure
backups have been archived to your archive location before removal.

Also included is the ability to remove empty folders as part of this cleanup activity.

.PARAMETER Path
Name of the base level folder to search for backup files.
Deletion of backup files will be recursive from this location.

.PARAMETER BackupFileExtension
Extension of the backup files you wish to remove (typically bak, trn or log)

.PARAMETER RetentionPeriod
Retention period for backup files. Correct format is ##U.

## is the retention value and must be an integer value
U signifies the units where the valid units are:
h = hours
d = days
w = weeks
m = months

Formatting Examples:
'48h' = 48 hours
'7d' = 7 days
'4w' = 4 weeks
'1m' = 1 month

.PARAMETER CheckArchiveBit
Checks the archive bit before deletion. If the file is "ready for archiving" (which translates to "it has not been backed up yet") it won't be removed

.PARAMETER RemoveEmptyBackupFolder
Remove any empty folders after the cleanup process is complete.

.PARAMETER Silent
Use this switch to disable any kind of verbose messages

.PARAMETER WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed.

.PARAMETER Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command.

.EXAMPLE
Remove-DbaBackup -Path 'C:\MSSQL\SQL Backup\' -BackupFileExtension trn -RetentionPeriod 48h

The cmdlet will remove '*.trn' files from 'C:\MSSQL\SQL Backup\' and all subdirectories that are more than 48 hours. 

.EXAMPLE
Remove-DbaBackup -Path 'C:\MSSQL\SQL Backup\' -BackupFileExtension trn -RetentionPeriod 48h -WhatIf

Same as example #1, but using the WhatIf parameter. The WhatIf parameter will allow the cmdlet show you what it will do, without actually doing it.
In this case, no trn files will be deleted. Instead, the cmdlet will output what it will do when it runs. This is a good preventatitive measure
especially when you are first configuring the cmdlet calls.

.EXAMPLE
Remove-DbaBackup -Path 'C:\MSSQL\Backup\' -BackupFileExtension bak -RetentionPeriod 7d -CheckArchiveBit

The cmdlet will remove '*.bak' files from 'C:\MSSQL\Backup\' and all subdirectories that are more than 7 days old. 
It will also ensure that the bak files have been archived using the archive bit before removing them.

.EXAMPLE
Remove-DbaBackup -Path 'C:\MSSQL\Backup\' -BackupFileExtension bak -RetentionPeriod 1w -RemoveEmptyBackupFolder

The cmdlet will remove '*.bak' files from 'C:\MSSQL\Backup\' and all subdirectories that are more than 1 week old. 
It will also remove any backup folders that no longer contain backup files.
